## 1. What is WinRAR?

WinRAR is a trialware file archiver utility for Windows, developed by Eugene Roshal of win.rar GmbH. 

It can create and view archives in RAR or ZIP file formats and unpack numerous archive file formats. 

WinRAR is not a free software. If you want to use it, you should pay to [__RARLAB__](https://www.rarlab.com/) and then you will get a license file named `rarreg.key`. 

This repository will tell you how WinRAR license file `"rarreg.key"` is generated. 

## 2. How is "rarreg.key" generated?

See [here](README.HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).

## 3. How to use?

There are several ways to use it:

- [Use Github Actions](#6-Use-Github-Actions) 
- [Use Github Actions with secrets](#7-Use-Github-Actions-with-secrets)
- [Build in Visual Studio](#8-Build-in-Visual-Studio)

## 4. Encoding

WinRAR Keygen supports `ASCII`, `ANSI` and `UTF-8` encoding types, the following is a brief description of the three encoding types.

> [!WARNING]
> It is recommended that you do not generate licenses with non-ASCII characters in ANSI encoding for the time being, as there is a problem with garbled PowerShell console characters for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean on Windows Server 2022, [which is being fixed by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/system-management-components/powershell-console-characters-garbled-for-cjk-languages).
>

| Encoding                                     | Instruction                                                  | Supported Characters                                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) | Single byte encoding only using the bottom 7 bits. (Unicode code points 0-127.) No accents etc. | Only full ASCII characters are supported.                    |
| ANSI                                         | There's no one fixed ANSI encoding - there are lots of them. Usually when people say "ANSI" they mean "the default locale/codepage for my system" which is obtained via [Encoding.Default](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.encoding.default.aspx), and is often [Windows-1252](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252) but can be other locales. | Only full ASCII characters and the language of your operating system are supported. |
| [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) | Variable length encoding, 1-4 bytes per code point. ASCII values are encoded as ASCII using 1 byte. | Support full UTF8 encoded characters.                        |

## 5. License type

There are two types of WinRAR licenses, `rarreg.key` and `rarkey.rar`, which differ only in their import.

|                   rarreg.key                   |                    rarkey.rar                    |
| :--------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------: |
| <img width="100px" src="assets/file-icon.svg"> | <img width="100px" src="assets/winrar-icon.svg"> |
|     Drag to import or place in a location      |       Double-click to run automatic import       |

If you are unable to drag, you can try to put the `rarreg.key` in the following directory.

```shell
C:\Users\yourname\AppData\Roaming\WinRAR\rarreg.key
```

You can also compress `rarreg.key` into `rarkey.rar` and double-click it to run it, and the license import will take place automatically.

## 6. Use Github Actions

## 8. Build in Visual Studio

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

I recommend using the Github Actions, but you can still do your own compilation.

If you don't want to compile it yourself, you can also go to the [release](https://github.com/bitcookies/winrar-keygen/releases/) page to get `winrar-keygen.exe`.

### 8.1 Prerequisites

1. Please make sure that you have **Visual Studio 2022**. Because this is a VS2022 project. If you are still using Visual Studio 2019, you can find projects for VS2019 in the [vs2019](https://github.com/bitcookies/winrar-keygen/tree/vs2019) branch, but this branch will no longer be maintained.

2. Please make sure you have installed `vcpkg` and the following libraries:

   * `mpir:x86-windows-static`
   * `mpir:x64-windows-static`

   is installed.

   You can install them by:

   ```shell
   $ vcpkg install mpir:x86-windows-static
   $ vcpkg install mpir:x64-windows-static
   ```

3. Your `vcpkg` has been integrated into your __Visual Studio__, which means you have run successfully.

   ```shell
   $ vcpkg integrate install
   ```
   

### 8.2 Build

1. Open this project in __Visual Studio__.

2. Select `Release` configuration.

3. Select __Build > Build Solution__.

You will see executable files in `bin/` directory. 

### 8.3 How to use?

Execute the following code in the terminal and configure two parameters to generate `rarreg.key`.

Here is an example of ASCII encoding for `Github` and `Single PC usage license`:

```shell
Usage:
        winrar-keygen.exe <Username> <License Name>

Example:

        winrar-keygen.exe "Github" "Single PC usage license"

  or:
        winrar-keygen.exe "Github" "Github.com" | Out-File -Encoding ASCII rarreg.key
```

![Terminal](assets/terminal.png)

Now you can see the newly generated file.

```console
RAR registration data
Github
Single PC usage license
UID=3a3d02329a32b63da7d8
6412212250a7d8753c5e7037d83011171578c57042fa30c506caae

5eede7ed46566b10bf033daa6384062b259194b1acbd0378116064
```

Save the generated information in **ANSI encoding** as `rarreg.key`.

### 8.4 Multi-language support

Execute the following code in the terminal and configure two paramet

When using ANSI encoding, you can only use characters from the country or region where your operating system is located. ANSI encoding is supported from Powershell 7.4 onwards, and you will also need to [upgrade your Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4).

Generate multi-language licenses in ANSI encoding.

```shell
winrar-keygen.exe "简体中文" "license" | Out-File -Encoding ansi rarreg.key

winrar-keygen.exe "繁體中文" "license" | Out-File -Encoding ansi rarreg.key

winrar-keygen.exe "Deutsch" "license" | Out-File -Encoding ansi rarreg.key

winrar-keygen.exe "Français" "license" | Out-File -Encoding ansi rarreg.key

winrar-keygen.exe "日本語" "license" | Out-File -Encoding ansi rarreg.key

winrar-keygen.exe "한국어" "license" | Out-File -Encoding ansi rarreg.key
```

When generating utf-8 licenses, you may need to check Use ***[Beta:Use Unicode UTF-8 for global language support](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57134096/10242225)*** in **Control Panel > Clock and Regions > Regions > Administration > Change System Region Settings** in order to process the data correctly. However, it is not recommended that you do this, which may cause many software to not work properly, and it is recommended to [Use Github Actions](#6-Use-Github-Actions).

Generate multi-language licenses with UTF-8 encoding.

> `utf8:` is to ensure constant character representation in WinRAR across languages.

```shell
winrar-keygen.exe "utf8:简体中文" "license" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 rarreg.key

winrar-keygen.exe "utf8:繁體中文" "license" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 rarreg.key

winrar-keygen.exe "utf8:Deutsch" "license" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 rarreg.key

winrar-keygen.exe "utf8:Français" "license" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 rarreg.key

winrar-keygen.exe "utf8:日本語" "license" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 rarreg.key

winrar-keygen.exe "utf8:한국어" "license" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 rarreg.key
```

</details>

## 9. Invalid key

Why is my `rarreg.key` invalid?

### 9.1 Character encoding

`TEXT1` and `TEXT2` are required to fulfill [corresponding coding requirements](#4 - coding description).

```console
winrar-keygen.exe <TEXT1> <TEXT2>
```

You can refer to: [Generation of "rarreg.key"](https://github.com/bitcookies/winrar-keygen/blob/master/README.HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md#7-generation-of-rarregkey)

### 9.2 Text encoding

If you use the following command:

```shell
winrar-keygen.exe "Github" "Single PC usage license" > rarreg.key
```

In the newer Windows 10, PowerShell will export in **UTF16-LE** format by default, which will cause the error.

Please use the following command:

```shell
winrar-keygen.exe "Github" "Github.com" | Out-File -Encoding ascii rarreg.key

winrar-keygen.exe "Github" "Github.com" | Out-File -Encoding ansi rarreg.key

winrar-keygen.exe "utf8:Github" "Github.com" | Out-File -Encoding utf8 rarreg.key
```
